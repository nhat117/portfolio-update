I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to apply my skills and knowledge in these fields to real-world problems.Throughout my studies, I have honed my programming skills in various languages including Python, Java, Javascript, C ++. I have also gained hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning ðŸ¤– ðŸ¤–. My experience in these areas has not only expanded my technical abilities but also allowed me to develop a strong foundation in data-driven problem-solving.ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ± In my free time, I like to engage in activities that complement my technical skills and help me bring a unique perspective to my work. I play piano to tap into my creative side, read books to broaden my knowledge and stay inspired, and take photographs ðŸ“¸ ðŸ“¸ to express my artistic vision."}</p>
